# PRODIGY_CS_01
Caesar Cipher Implementation

This Python script implements a Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption technique used to encode messages by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a specified number of positions. The script supports both encryption and decryption modes.

How It Works:

Encryption: Each letter in the input text is shifted forward by a specified number of positions (shift value).

Decryption: Each letter in the input text is shifted backward by the specified number of positions.
The script handles both uppercase and lowercase letters while preserving non-alphabet characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation).

Usage:

Input your message: Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.

Enter the shift value: A number indicating how many positions each letter should be shifted.

Select mode: Choose either 'encrypt' to encode your message or 'decrypt' to decode it.

The result is displayed as the output.
